## Setup pgagroal-vault

This tutorial will show you how to do setup `pgagroal-vault`.

### Preface

This tutorial assumes that you have already an installation of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 13 (or higher) and [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) and also assumes that the remote management is enabled in [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal).

In particular, this tutorial refers to the configuration done in [Install pgagroal](https://github.com/pgagroal/pgagroal/blob/master/doc/tutorial/01_install.md).

Moreover refer to [Enable Remote Management](https://github.com/pgagroal/pgagroal/blob/master/doc/tutorial/03_remote_management.md) to enable remote management and add remote admin user.

### `pgagroal` users setup

Assuming that the master key is already generated and an admin is already present for remote management with `admin` username and `admin1234` password.

**Create a user**

As the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user, add the `myuser` to the pooler:

```
pgagroal-admin -f /etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_users.conf -U myuser -P mypassword user add
```

The `myuser` and `mypassword` should be the original PostgresSQL's user and its corresponding password.

**Create a frontend user**

As the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user, add the `myuser` to the pooler:

```
pgagroal-admin -f /etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_frontend_users.conf -U myuser -P password user add
```

**Remember the frontend password should be between [8-1024] characters long.**

### Enable Rotation of frontend passwords

In the main configuration file of [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) add the following configurations for rotating frontend passwords and make sure management port is enabled in the **[pgagroal]** section of the configuration file.

```
management = 2347
rotate_frontend_password_timeout = 60
rotate_frontend_password_length = 12
```

### `pgagroal-vault` setup

In order to run `pgagroal-vault`, you need to configure the vault `pgagroal_vault.conf` configuration file, that will tell the vault how to work, which address to listen, address of management service in [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) so on, and then `pgagroal_vault_users.conf` that will instrument the vault about the admin username and password of the remote management.

**Create basic configuration**

It is now time to create the main `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_vault.conf` configuration file, with your editor of choice or using `cat` from the command line, create the following content:

```
cd /etc/pgagroal
cat > pgagroal_vault.conf
[pgagroal-vault]
host = localhost
port = 2500

log_type = file
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgagroal_vault.log

[main]
host = localhost
port = 2347
user = admin
```

and press `Ctrl-d` (if running `cat`) to save the file.

**Add users file**

As the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user, run the following command:

```
pgagroal-admin -f /etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_vault_users.conf -U admin -P admin1234 add-user
```

The above will create the `admin` username with the `admin1234` password.Alternately, `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_admins.conf` can be provided for vault users information.

See [the documentation about `pgagroal_vault.conf` for more details](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/blob/master/doc/VAULT.md).

### Start pgagroal-vault

It is now time to start `pgagroal-vault`, so as the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user run:

```
pgagroal-vault -d
```

**Remember if both pgagroal and vault are operating on same system `pgagroal_vault_users.conf` can be same as `pgagroal_admins.conf`**

This command initializes an HTTP server on localhost port 2500, which is primed to exclusively handle GET requests from clients.

### Connect to vault

Since we have deployed an HTTP server we can simply use `curl` to send GET requests

**Correct requests**

If the requested URL is of form `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/<frontend_user>` such that `<frontend_user>` exists, the server will return a header response with `200 status code` and the frontend password corresponding to the `<frontend_user>` in the response body.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/users/myuser
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain


password
```

**Incorrect requests**

All the POST requests will be ignored and the server will send a `HTTP 404 ERROR` as a response.

Any URL other than the format: `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/*` will result in `HTTP 404 ERROR`.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/user
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

A URL of form `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/<frontend_user>` such that `<frontend_user>` does not exist will also give `HTTP 404 ERROR`.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/users/randomuser
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```
