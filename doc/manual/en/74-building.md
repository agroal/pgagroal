## Building pgagroal

### Overview

[**pgagroal**][pgagroal] can be built using CMake, where the build system will detect the compiler and apply appropriate flags for debugging and testing.

The main build system is defined in [CMakeLists.txt][cmake_txt]. The flags for Sanitizers are added in compile options in [src/CMakeLists.txt][src/cmake_txt]

### Compiling

Install the dependencies with

```sh
dnf install git gcc cmake make      \
            liburing liburing-devel \
            openssl openssl-devel   \
            systemd systemd-devel   \
            python3-docutils        \
            libatomic               \
            zlib zlib-devel         \
            libzstd libzstd-devel   \
            lz4 lz4-devel           \
            bzip2 bzip2-devel
```

To build [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] in release mode:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
make
```

or in debug mode:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

The compiler can also be specified for example
```
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
# or
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
```

The build system will automatically detect the compiler version and enable the appropriate flags based on support.

### Compiling the documentation

[**pgagroal**][pgagroal]'s documentation requires

* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

```sh
dnf install pandoc texlive-scheme-basic \
            'tex(footnote.sty)' 'tex(footnotebackref.sty)' \
            'tex(pagecolor.sty)' 'tex(hardwrap.sty)' \
            'tex(mdframed.sty)' 'tex(sourcesanspro.sty)' \
            'tex(ly1enc.def)' 'tex(sourcecodepro.sty)' \
            'tex(titling.sty)' 'tex(csquotes.sty)' \
            'tex(zref-abspage.sty)' 'tex(needspace.sty)'
```

You will need the `Eisvogel` template as well which you can install through

```sh
wget https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template/releases/download/v3.3.0/Eisvogel-3.3.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf Eisvogel-3.3.0.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pandoc/templates
mv Eisvogel-3.3.0/eisvogel.latex ~/.local/share/pandoc/templates/
```

where `$HOME` is your home directory.

### Generate API guide

This process is optional. If you choose not to generate the API HTML files, you can opt out of downloading these dependencies, and the process will automatically skip the generation.

Download dependencies

``` sh
dnf install graphviz doxygen
```

These packages will be detected during `cmake` and built as part of the main build.

### Policy and guidelines for using AI

Our goal in the pgagroal project is to develop an excellent software system. This requires careful attention to
detail in every change we integrate. Maintainer time and attention is very limited, so it's important that changes
you ask us to review represent your best work.

You are encouraged to use tools that help you write good code, including AI tools. However, as noted above, you always
need to understand and explain the changes you're proposing to make, whether or not you used an LLM as part of
your process to produce them. The answer to “Why did you make change X?” should never be “I'm not sure. The AI did it.”

Do not submit an AI-generated PR you haven't personally understood and tested, as this wastes maintainers' time.
PRs that appear to violate this guideline will be closed without review. Using AI as a coding assistant and help you
create a skeleton for your code.

* Don't skip becoming familiar with the part of the codebase you're working on. This will let you write better prompts
  and validate their output if you use an LLM. Code assistants can be a useful search engine/discovery tool in this process,
  but don't trust claims they make about how pgagroal works. LLMs are often wrong, even about details that are clearly
  answered in the pgagroal documentation and surrounding code
* Don't simply ask an LLM to add code comments, as it will likely produce a bunch of text that unnecessarily explains
  what's already clear from the code. If using an LLM to generate comments, be really specific in your request,
  demand succinctness, and carefully edit the result.

**Using AI for communication**

As noted above, pgagroal's contributors are expected to communicate with intention, to avoid wasting maintainer time
with long, sloppy writing. We strongly prefer clear and concise communication about points that actually require discussion
over long AI-generated comments.

When you use an LLM to write a message for you, it remains your responsibility to read through the whole thing and make sure
that it makes sense to you and represents your ideas concisely. A good rule of thumb is that if you can't make yourself
carefully read some LLM output that you generated, nobody else wants to read it either.

Here are some concrete guidelines for using LLMs as part of your communication workflows.

* When writing a pull request description, do not include anything that's obvious from looking at your changes directly
  (e.g., files changed, functions updated, etc.). Instead, focus on the why behind your changes. Don't ask an LLM to
  generate a PR description on your behalf based on your code changes, as it will simply regurgitate the information
  that's already there.
* Similarly, when responding to a pull request comment, explain your reasoning. Don't prompt an LLM to re-describe what
  can already be seen from the code.
* Verify that everything you write is accurate, whether or not an LLM generated any part of it. pgagroal's maintainers
  will be unable to review your contributions if you misrepresent your work (e.g., misdescribing your code changes,
  their effect, or your testing process).
* Complete all parts of the PR description template, maybe with screenshots and the self-review checklist.
  Don't simply overwrite the template with LLM output.
* Clarity and succinctness are much more important than perfect grammar, so you shouldn't feel obliged to pass your writing
  through an LLM. If you do ask an LLM to clean up your writing style, be sure it does not make it longer in the process.
  Demand succinctness in your prompt.
* Quoting an LLM answer is usually less helpful than linking to relevant primary sources, like source code,
  reference documentation, or web standards. If you do need to quote an LLM answer in a pgagroal conversation,
  put the answer in a pgagroal quote block, to distinguish LLM output from your own thoughts.

### Sanitizer

Before building pgagroal with sanitizer support, ensure you have the required packages installed:

* `libasan` - AddressSanitizer runtime library
* `libasan-static` - Static version of AddressSanitizer runtime library

On Red Hat/Fedora systems:
```
sudo dnf install libasan libasan-static
```

Package names and versions may vary depending on your distribution and compiler version.

### Sanitizer Flags

**AddressSanitizer (ASAN)**

Address Sanitizer is a memory error detector that helps find use-after-free, heap/stack/global buffer overflow, use-after-return, initialization order bugs, and memory leaks.

**UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN)**

UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is a fast undefined behavior detector that can find various types of undefined behavior during program execution, such as integer overflow, null pointer dereference, and more.

**Common Flags**

* `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` - Provides better stack traces in error reports
* `-Wall -Wextra` - Enables additional compiler warnings

**GCC Support**

* `-fsanitize=address` - Enables the Address Sanitizer (GCC 4.8+)
* `-fsanitize=undefined` - Enables the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (GCC 4.9+)
* `-fno-sanitize=alignment` - Disables alignment checking (GCC 5.1+)
* `-fno-sanitize-recover=all` - Makes all sanitizers halt on error (GCC 5.1+)
* `-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero` - Detects floating-point division by zero (GCC 5.1+)
* `-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow` - Detects floating-point cast overflows (GCC 5.1+)
* `-fsanitize-recover=address` - Allows the program to continue execution after detecting an error (GCC 6.0+)
* `-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope` - Detects use-after-scope bugs (GCC 7.0+)

**Clang Support**

* `-fsanitize=address` - Enables the Address Sanitizer (Clang 3.2+)
* `-fno-sanitize=null` - Disables null pointer dereference checking (Clang 3.2+)
* `-fno-sanitize=alignment` - Disables alignment checking (Clang 3.2+)
* `-fsanitize=undefined` - Enables the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (Clang 3.3+)
* `-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero` - Detects floating-point division by zero (Clang 3.3+)
* `-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow` - Detects floating-point cast overflows (Clang 3.3+)
* `-fno-sanitize-recover=all` - Makes all sanitizers halt on error (Clang 3.6+)
* `-fsanitize-recover=address` - Allows the program to continue execution after detecting an error (Clang 3.8+)
* `-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope` - Detects use-after-scope bugs (Clang 3.9+)

### Additional Sanitizer Options

Developers can add additional sanitizer flags via environment variables. Some useful options include:

**ASAN Options**

* `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1` - Enables memory leak detection
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0` - Continues execution after errors
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1` - Enables stack use-after-return detection
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=check_initialization_order=1` - Detects initialization order problems
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=strict_string_checks=1` - Enables strict string function checking
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2` - Enhanced pointer pair validation
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=print_stats=1` - Prints statistics about allocated memory
* `ASAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1` - Increases logging verbosity

**UBSAN Options**

* `UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1` - Prints stack traces for errors
* `UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1` - Stops execution on the first error
* `UBSAN_OPTIONS=silence_unsigned_overflow=1` - Silences unsigned integer overflow reports

### Building with Sanitizers

To build [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] with sanitizer support:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

The compiler can also be specified
```
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
# or
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
```

The build system will automatically detect the compiler version and enable the appropriate sanitizer flags based on support.

## Running with Sanitizers

When running [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] built with sanitizers, any errors will be reported to stderr.

To get more detailed reports, you can set additional environment variables:

```
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:halt_on_error=0:detect_stack_use_after_return=1 ./pgagroal
```

You can combine ASAN and UBSAN options:

```
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 ./pgagroal
```

## Advanced Sanitizer Options Not Included by Default

Developers may want to experiment with additional sanitizer flags not enabled by default:

* `-fsanitize=memory` - Enables MemorySanitizer (MSan) for detecting uninitialized reads (Note this can't be used with ASan)
* `-fsanitize=integer` - Only check integer operations (subset of UBSan)
* `-fsanitize=bounds` - Array bounds checking (subset of UBSan)
* `-fsanitize-memory-track-origins` - Tracks origins of uninitialized values (with MSan)
* `-fsanitize-memory-use-after-dtor` - Detects use-after-destroy bugs (with MSan)
* `-fno-common` - Prevents variables from being merged into common blocks, helping identify variable access issues

Note that some sanitizers are incompatible with each other. For example, you cannot use ASan and MSan together.
