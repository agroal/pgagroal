# Configuration

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-c` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal.conf`.

The configuration of [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] is split into sections using the `[` and `]` characters.

The main section, called `[pgagroal]`, is where you configure the overall properties of [**pgagroal**][pgagroal].

Other sections doesn't have any requirements to their naming so you can give them meaningful names like `[primary]` for the primary [PostgreSQL][postgresql] instance.

All properties are in the format `key = value`.

The characters `#` and `;` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.

The `Bool` data type supports the following values: `on`, `yes`, `1`, `true`, `off`, `no`, `0` and `false`.

See a [sample][sample] configuration for running [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] on `localhost`.

## [pgagroal]

This section is mandatory and the pooler will refuse to start if the configuration file does not specify one and only one. Usually this section is place on top of the configuration file, but its position within the file does not really matter.
The available keys and their accepted values are reported in the table below.

Please note that `strict` and `minimal` are honored only on those systems that do not provide a native way to set the process title (e.g., Linux). On other systems, there is no difference between `strict` and `minimal` and the assumed behaviour is `minimal` even if `strict` is used. `never` and `verbose` are always honored, on every system. On Linux systems the process title is always trimmed to 255 characters, while on system that provide a natve way to set the process title it can be longer. |

### Server section

Each section with a name different from [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) will be treated as an host section.
There can be up to `64` host sections, each with an unique name and different combination of `host` and `port` settings, otherwise the pooler will complain about duplicated server configuration.

| Property | Default | Unit | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| host | | String | Yes | The address of the PostgreSQL instance |
| port | | Int | Yes | The port of the PostgreSQL instance |

| tls | `off` | Bool | No | Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) support (Experimental - no pooling). Changes require restart. |
| tls_cert_file | | String | No | Certificate file for TLS. This file must be owned by either the user running pgagroal or root. Changes require restart. |
| tls_key_file | | String | No | Private key file for TLS. This file must be owned by either the user running pgagroal or root. Additionally permissions must be at least `0640` when owned by root or `0600` otherwise.Changes require restart. |
| tls_ca_file | | String | No | Certificate Authority (CA) file for TLS. This file must be owned by either the user running pgagroal or root. Changes require restart. |

Note, that if `host` starts with a `/` it represents a path and [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) will connect using a Unix Domain Socket.

## pgagroal_hba configuration

The `pgagroal_hba` configuration controls access to [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) through host-based authentication.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-a` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_hba.conf`.

The format of the file follows the similar [PostgreSQL HBA configuration format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html), and as such looks like

```
#
# TYPE  DATABASE USER  ADDRESS  METHOD
#
host    all      all   all      all
```

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| TYPE   | Yes      | Specifies the access method for clients. `host` and `hostssl` are supported |
| DATABASE | Yes      | Specifies the database for the rule. Either specific name or `all` for all databases |
| USER | Yes      | Specifies the user for the rule. Either specific name or `all` for all users |
| ADDRESS | Yes      | Specifies the network for the rule. `all` for all networks, or IPv4 address with a mask (`0.0.0.0/0`) or IPv6 address with a mask (`::0/0`) |
| METHOD | Yes      | Specifies the authentication mode for the user. `all` for all methods, otherwise `trust`, `reject`, `password`, `md5` or `scram-sha-256` |

Remote management users needs to have their database set to `admin` in order for the entry to be considered.

There can be up to `64` HBA entries in the configuration file.

## pgagroal_databases configuration

The `pgagroal_databases` configuration defines limits for a database or a user or both. The limits are the number
of connections from [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) to PostgreSQL for each entry.

The file also defines the initial and minimum pool size for a database and user pair. Note, that this feature requires
a user definition file, see below.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-l` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_databases.conf`.

```
#
# DATABASE USER    MAX_SIZE INITIAL_SIZE MIN_SIZE
#
mydb       myuser  all
anotherdb  userB   10           5       3
```

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| DATABASE | Yes | Specifies the database for the rule. `all` for all databases |
| USER | Yes | Specifies the user for the rule. `all` for all users |
| MAX_SIZE | Yes | Specifies the maximum pool size for the entry. `all` for all remaining counts from `max_connections` |
| INITIAL_SIZE | No | Specifies the initial pool size for the entry. `all` for `MAX_SIZE` connections. Default is 0 |
| MIN_SIZE | No | Specifies the minimum pool size for the entry. `all` for `MAX_SIZE` connections. Default is 0 |


There can be up to `64` entries in the configuration file.

In the case a limit entry has incoherent values, for example `INITIAL_SIZE` smaller than `MIN_SIZE`, the system will try to automatically adjust the settings on the fly, reporting messages in the logs.

The system will find the best match limit entry for a given `DATABASE`-`USER` pair according to the following rules:
1. Use the first entry with an exact `DATABASE` and `USER` match.
2. If there is no exact match, use the entry with a `USER` match and `DATABASE` set to `all`.
3. If Rule 2 does not apply, use the entry with a `DATABASE` match and `USER` set to `all`.

## pgagroal_users configuration

The `pgagroal_users` configuration defines the users known to the system. This file is created and managed through the `pgagroal-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-u` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_users.conf`.

## pgagroal_frontend_users configuration

The `pgagroal_frontend_users` configuration defines the passwords for the users connecting to pgagroal.
This allows the setup to use different passwords for the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) to PostgreSQL authentication.
This file is created and managed through the `pgagroal-admin` tool.

All users defined in the frontend authentication must be defined in the user vault (`-u`).

Frontend users (`-F`) requires a user vault (`-u`) to be defined.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-F` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_frontend_users.conf`.

## pgagroal_admins configuration

The `pgagroal_admins` configuration defines the administrators known to the system. This file is created and managed through the `pgagroal-admin` tool.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-A` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_admins.conf`.

If pgagroal has both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and `management` enabled then `pgagroal-cli` can connect with TLS using the files `~/.pgagroal/pgagroal.key` (must be 0600 permission), `~/.pgagroal/pgagroal.crt` and `~/.pgagroal/root.crt`.

## pgagroal_superuser configuration

The `pgagroal_superuser` configuration defines the superuser known to the system. This file is created and managed through
the `pgagroal-admin` tool. It may only have one user defined.

The configuration is loaded from either the path specified by the `-S` flag or `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_superuser.conf`.
