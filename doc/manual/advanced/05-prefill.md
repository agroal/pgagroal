# Prefill

## Create prefill configuration

Prefill is instrumented by the `pgagroal_databases.conf` configuration file, where you need
to list databases, usernames, and limits. Every username/database pair has to be specified on a separated line.

The limits are assumed as:

* *max number of allowed connections* for that username/database
* *initial number of connections*, that is the effective prefill;
* *minimum number of connections* to always keep open for the pair username/database.

Assuming you want to configure the prefill for the `mydb` database with the `myuser` username,
you have to edit the file `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_databases.conf` with your editor of choice
or using `cat` from the command line, as follows:

```
cd /etc/pgagroal
cat > pgagroal_databases.conf
mydb   myuser   2   1   0
```

and press `Ctrl-d` to save the file.

This will create a configuration where `mydb` will have a maximum connection size of 2,
an initial connection size of 1 and a minimum connection size of 0 for the `myuser` user.

The file must be owned by the operating system user [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal).

The `max_size` value is mandatory, while the `initial_size` and `min_size` are optional and if not explicitly set are assumed to be `0`.
See [the `pgagroal_databases.conf` file documentation](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/blob/master/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#pgagroal_databases-configuration) for more details.

## Restart pgagroal

In order to apply changes to the prefill configuration, you need to restart [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal).
You can do so by stopping it and then re-launch the daemon, as [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user:

```
pgagroal-cli shutdown
pgagroal -d
```

## Check the prefill

You can check the prefill by running, as the [**pgagroal**](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal) operating system user, the `status` command:

```
pgagroal-cli status
Status:              Running
Active connections:  0
Total connections:   1
Max connections:     100

```

where the `Total connections` is set by the *initial* connection specified in the limit file.
