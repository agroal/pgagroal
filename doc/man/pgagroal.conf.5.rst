pgagroal.conf is the main configuration file for pgagroal.

The file is split into different sections specified by the ``[`` and ``]`` characters. The main section is called ``[pgagroal]``.

Other sections specifies the PostgreSQL server configuration.

All properties are in the format ``key = value``.

The characters ``#`` and ``;`` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.

The options for the main section are

host
  The bind address for pgagroal. Mandatory

port
  The bind port for pgagroal. Mandatory

unix_socket_dir
  The Unix Domain Socket location. Mandatory

metrics
  The metrics port. Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_age
  The amount of time to keep a Prometheus (metrics) response in cache. If this value is specified without units,
  it is taken as seconds. It supports the following units as suffixes: 'S' for seconds (default), 'M' for minutes,

  Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_size
  The maximum amount of data to keep in cache when serving Prometheus responses. Changes require restart.
  This parameter determines the size of memory allocated for the cache even if ``metrics_cache_max_age`` or

log_path
  The log file location. Default is pgagroal.log. Can be a strftime(3) compatible string

update_process_title
  The behavior for updating the operating system process title, mainly related to connection processes.
  Allowed settings are: ``never`` (or ``off``), does not update the process title; ``strict`` to set the
  process title without overriding the existing initial process title length; ``minimal`` to set the process
  title to ``username/database``; ``verbose`` (or ``full``) to set the process title to ``user@host:port/database``.
  Please note that ``strict`` and ``minimal`` are honored only on those systems that do not provide a native way
  to set the process title (e.g., Linux). On other systems, there is no difference between ``strict`` and ``minimal``
  and the assumed behaviour is ``minimal`` even if ``strict`` is used. ``never`` and ``verbose`` are always honored,
  on every system. On Linux systems the process title is always trimmed to 255 characters, while on system that
  provide a natve way to set the process title it can be longer
