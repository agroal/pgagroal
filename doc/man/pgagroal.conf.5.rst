------------------------------------

:Manual section: 5

DESCRIPTION
===========

pgagroal.conf is the main configuration file for pgagroal.

The file is split into different sections specified by the ``[`` and ``]`` characters. The main section is called ``[pgagroal]``.

Other sections specifies the PostgreSQL server configuration.

All properties are in the format ``key = value``.

The characters ``#`` and ``;`` can be used for comments; must be the first character on the line.
The ``Bool`` data type supports the following values: ``on``, ``1``, ``true``, ``off``, ``0`` and ``false``.

OPTIONS
=======

The options for the main section are

host
  The bind address for pgagroal. Mandatory

port
  The bind port for pgagroal. Mandatory

unix_socket_dir
  The Unix Domain Socket location. Mandatory

metrics
  The metrics port. Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_age
  The number of seconds to keep in cache a Prometheus (metrics) response.
  If set to zero, the caching will be disabled. Can be a string with a suffix, like ``2m`` to indicate 2 minutes.
  Default is 0 (disabled)

metrics_cache_max_size
  The maximum amount of data to keep in cache when serving Prometheus responses. Changes require restart.
  This parameter determines the size of memory allocated for the cache even if ``metrics_cache_max_age`` or
  ``metrics`` are disabled. Its value, however, is taken into account only if ``metrics_cache_max_age`` is set
  to a non-zero value. Supports suffixes: ``B`` (bytes), the default if omitted, ``K`` or ``KB`` (kilobytes),
  ``M`` or ``MB`` (megabytes), ``G`` or ``GB`` (gigabytes).
  Default is 256k

management
  The remote management port. Default is 0 (disabled)

log_type
  The logging type (console, file, syslog). Default is console

log_level
  The logging level, any of the (case insensitive) strings ``FATAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARN``, ``INFO`` and ``DEBUG``
  (that can be more specific as ``DEBUG1`` thru ``DEBUG5``). Debug level greater than 5 will be set to ``DEBUG5``.
  Not recognized values will make the ``log_level`` be ``INFO``. Default is info

log_path
  The log file location. Default is pgagroal.log. Can be a strftime(3) compatible string

log_rotation_age
  The age that will trigger a log file rotation. If expressed as a positive number, is managed as seconds.
  Supports suffixes: ``S`` (seconds, the default), ``M`` (minutes), ``H`` (hours), ``D`` (days), ``W`` (weeks).
  A value of ``0`` disables. Default is 0 (disabled)

log_rotation_size
  The size of the log file that will trigger a log rotation. Supports suffixes: ``B`` (bytes), the default if omitted,
  ``K`` or ``KB`` (kilobytes), ``M`` or ``MB`` (megabytes), ``G`` or ``GB`` (gigabytes). A value of ``0`` (with or without suffix) disables.
  Default is 0

log_line_prefix
  A strftime(3) compatible string to use as prefix for every log line. Must be quoted if contains spaces.
  Default is ``%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S``

log_mode
  Append to or create the log file (append, create). Default is append

log_connections
  Log connects. Default is off

log_disconnections
  Log disconnects. Default is off

blocking_timeout
  The number of seconds the process will be blocking for a connection (disable = 0). Default is 30

idle_timeout
  The number of seconds a connection is been kept alive (disable = 0). Default is 0

  Should connection validation be performed. Valid options: off, foreground and background. Default is off

background_interval
  The interval between background validation scans in seconds. Default is 300

max_retries

allow_unknown_users
  Allow unknown users to connect. Default is true

auth_query
  Enable authentication query. Default is false

failover
  Enable failover support. Default is false

failover_script
  The failover script

tls
  Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS). Default is false. Changes require restart in the server section.

tls_cert_file
  Certificate file for TLS. Changes require restart in the server section.

tls_key_file
  Private key file for TLS. Changes require restart in the server section.

tls_ca_file
  Certificate Authority (CA) file for TLS. Changes require restart in the server section.

libev
  The libev backend to use. Valid options: auto, select, poll, epoll, iouring, devpoll and port. Default is auto

hugepage
  Huge page support. Default is try

tracker
  Track connection lifecycle. Default is off

track_prepared_statements
  Track prepared statements (transaction pooling). Default is off

pidfile
  Path to the PID file. If omitted, automatically set to ``unix_socket_dir/pgagroal.port.pid``

update_process_title
  The behavior for updating the operating system process title, mainly related to connection processes.
  Allowed settings are: ``never`` (or ``off``), does not update the process title; ``strict`` to set the
  process title without overriding the existing initial process title length; ``minimal`` to set the process
  title to ``username/database``; ``verbose`` (or ``full``) to set the process title to ``user@host:port/database``.
  Please note that ``strict`` and ``minimal`` are honored only on those systems that do not provide a native way
  to set the process title (e.g., Linux). On other systems, there is no difference between ``strict`` and ``minimal``
  and the assumed behaviour is ``minimal`` even if ``strict`` is used. ``never`` and ``verbose`` are always honored,
  on every system. On Linux systems the process title is always trimmed to 255 characters, while on system that
  provide a natve way to set the process title it can be longer

Danger zone

disconnect_client
  Disconnect clients that have been idle for more than the specified seconds. This setting DOES NOT take long running transactions into account. Default is 0

disconnect_client_force
  Disconnect clients that have been active for more than the specified seconds. This setting DOES NOT take long running transactions into account. Default is off
